        <p>
            Yakisoba is a stir-fried noodle dish that typically includes meat or seafood,
            as well as vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, onions, and bean sprouts.
        </p>

        <p>
            These ingredients are all cooked together in a thick, sweet-savory sauce,
            and the final dish is usually topped with aonori (dried green seaweed)
            and red pickled ginger for added flavor.
